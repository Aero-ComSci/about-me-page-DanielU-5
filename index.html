    <article style="padding-left:25%;padding-right:25%">
        <h4 style="text-indent:50px">Hello, my name is Daniel Ureno. 
        From a young age I found great interest in the field of technology and engineering. 
        My goal is to get my bachelor degree in Software Engineering and get hired for my dream job. 
        I hope to also inspire others to do the same and strive for the best version of themselves. 
        I plan to continue to grow and learn by challenging myself and finding creative solutions to everyday problems.</h4>
        <h4 style="text-indent:50px">I am very self-motivated and am willing to put in the work. 
            Self-motivation has really helped me improve in baseball as I practice every day to be the best player I can be. 
            I am also a natural leader and know how to collaborate with others. 
            As a catcher I am the only position that can see the whole field. 
            It is my responsibility to make sure that my team is positioned correctly and I need to know how to lead the team.</h4>
        <h4 style="text-indent:50px">Achievements are results of hard work and dedication. 
            I won the MVP in a travel ball tournament which means that I was the best player on the best team at that tournament. 
            This means a lot to me because it shows how my hard work paid off. Although this was a big accomplishment I will not stop there. 
            I will continue to be a better me everyday in every way I can.</h4>
